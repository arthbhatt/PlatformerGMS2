Story Idea #1:
Medieval fantasy setting. You are a lowly toilet cleaner for the King's Knights. But have always wanted to charge in to battle. With the recent defeat of the knights at the Shenjen Fort, you decide to take matters into your own hands...
Only equipped with plungers, they are your fighting sticks and you can scale up walls. Thus begins your arduous climb up the fort. Along the way you pick up some rope as well. With the rope tied to your plunger, victory cannot be any closer. Throw the plunger on to walls and platforms to swing. It can also be thrown on enemies and objects to swing them around.

Story Idea #2:

Parody of spiderman. You are a sweet kid about to graduate high school. One day, you almost end up squishing a strange silk worm in your backyard. Taking pity on the little bug, you take it in. Provide it with glass jar as its home and some green leaves inside but forget to put the lid on top.

Night falls. As you sleep, the little fucker crawls up your arse. A strange discovery awaits you.

The next morning, you start your daily excercise. As you do your squat, you end up shooting a silk web out of your arse. Bewildered and ashamed you keep it a secret.

Some days later, you go on a hike with your uncle. Caught in a rhino encounter, you climb up a tree. Your uncle being old, can't climb. You shuffle around trying to find a rope to throw. But nary a rope was found. Too ashamed to drop your pants and produce one at the spot, you watch your uncle get impaled to the tree. 

But regret eats away at you. So, drop your pant and don a mask to protect the innocent and needy.
