* Also try fixing the aiming to just 8 directions (multiples of 45). Might be easier to control.
* Update collision detection to remove the loop and make the player directly snap to the final position.
* Learn how to write scripts in gamemaker, so the code can be more modular
* Learn when steps functions are called. Would the game run at different speeds on different PCs?
* See why tile is snapping wrt a larger grid. Objects do not have this restriction. Moreover they can be resized. If this is indeed a limitation when working with tile sets, make its width and height smaller so as to have greater flexibility during level creation.
* Move forward with Shaun spalding tutorial series...
* Make the game scale to different resolutions

Done:
* Change sprites and make the player object to be a square. Also made the background a solid color and removed visibility of cloud and grain layers.

*Check why gun rotation is jerky at angles which are a multiple of 45 degrees. The answer is because there in change in the axis measurement at these points. 

Failed Trials:

* Make you player character jump in the direction in which the left analog stick is pointing
